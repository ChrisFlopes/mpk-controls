            <p>Each board linked to others allows for the fire lock outs to function ensuring that all floors not active in fire cannot be opened as per current regulations.</p>
            
            <p>Each zone board can either be individually controlled or linked collectively to thermostats/BMS inputs for environmental cooling and if connected to a rain sensor will close.</p>
